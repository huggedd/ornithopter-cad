# Ornithopter CAD Project

## Overview
This project is a **3D CAD model of an Ornithopter**, created in *Autodesk Fusion 360*.  
The design explores **biomimicry in aerospace engineering**, inspired by bird and bat wing structures.  
It demonstrates articulated wings with lightweight frame design and aerodynamic surfaces.
